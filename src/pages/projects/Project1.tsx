Users frequently expressed uncertainty about whether their actions, such as inventory updates or order processing, were successfully executed. To enhance clarity and user confidence, we propose integrating more explicit feedback mechanisms into the app's workflow. This approach includes the implementation of toast messages and clear visual indicators to affirm that an action has been successfully completed. These additions are aimed at reducing user frustration and improving the overall efficiency and user satisfaction with the app.",
